### Create a virtual environment ###

First, you will need to install `virtualenv` if you don't have it yet. Its convenient to use virtual environments to keep your dependencies separate and organized.

You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Then to create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
virtualenv myenv
```
Where `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then to activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate # for Linux and macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate # for Windows
```
Where `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.
```
### Install Django ###

Now we are going to install LTS version of Django. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
pip install django==4.2.10
```
