# Installation #

## Djanog ##

As of today the Long Term Support(LTS) version is 4.2.10  [February 2024]

### Create a virtual environment ###

First, you will need to install `virtualenv` if you don't have it yet. Its convenient to use virtual environments to keep your dependencies separate and organized.

You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Then to create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
virtualenv env
```
Where `env` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then to activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source env/bin/activate # for Linux and macOS
env\Scripts\activate # for Windows
```
Where `env` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.

### Install TailwindCSS ###

Now we are going to install LTS version of Django. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
pip install django==4.2.10
``` 

### Install TailwindCSS ###

As recommended by the [TailwindCSS](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/django/#install-flowbite) documentation, we will use `npm` to install TailwindCSS. If you don't have `npm` installed yet, you can download it from the official website.[Node LTE 20.11.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.1/node-v20.11.1-linux-x64.tar.xz)
 
Restart your terminal after installing `npm` to make sure it's available.
```bash
node -v
```
```bash
npm -v
```
After installing `npm`, you can now install TailwindCSS.
1. Run the following command the install Tailwind CSS as a dev dependency using NPM:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
```
2. Create a TailwindCSS configuration file by running the following command:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```
3. Configure the template paths using the content value inside the Tailwind configuration file:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
      './templates/**/*.html'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
{there is a file called tailwind.config.js in the root directory of the project}
{there a catch while configuringit for djanog, the below is on doc of tailwindcss}
{Then below config is have tested and working for djanog}

```js
```

### Install Flowbit ###

Flowbite is an open source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS and 
it can be installed using NPM and required as a plugin inside Tailwind CSS.

1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM:
```bash
npm install flowbite
```

2. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
    ]

}
```
3. Include Flowbite inside the content value of the tailwind.config.js file:
```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
      './templates/**/*.html',
      './node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
4. nclude Flowbiteâ€™s JavaScript file inside the _base.html file just before the end of the <body> tag using CDN or by including it directly from the node_modules/ folder:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.3.0/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```
ow that you have everything configured you can check out the components from Flowbite such as navbars, modals, buttons, datepickers, and more.

## Starting a new project ##

To start a new project, run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject core
```
Where `core` is the name of your project. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd core
```
Where `core` is the name of your project. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then create a new app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp app
```
Where `app` is the name of your app. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then navigate to the app directory:

```bash
cd app
```
Where `app` is the name of your app. You can replace it with your preferred name.

### Now we are going to do so configurations to make sure that TailwindCSS is working.

1. Go to your app and create a new folder called `static/src/output.css and input.css` 
and `templates/base.html`:

1.1 There is one more this to do before point number 2, we need to install compressor to compress the css and js files
```bash
pip install django-compressor
```
1.2 Then add the following configuration to the `settings.py` file: 
 Go to Settings.py and add the following configuration:
```python
    "app",
    "compressor",
```
```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "DIRS": [BASE_DIR / "templates"], # Add this line <<<< this 
        "APP_DIRS": True,
        "OPTIONS": {
            "context_processors": [
                "django.template.context_processors.debug",
                "django.template.context_processors.request",
                "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
                "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",
            ],
        },
    },
]
```
```python
import os
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = "static/"

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# import os

# Using os.path.join()
COMPRESS_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")

# Or using Path.joinpath() if BASE_DIR is a Path object
# from pathlib import Path

COMPRESS_ROOT = Path(BASE_DIR).joinpath("static")

COMPRESS_ENABLED = True

# STATICFILES_FINDERS = ("compressor.finders.CompressorFinder",)

STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    # other finders..
    'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
)
```

Create a new views.py file inside myapp/ next to urls.py and add the following content:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')
Import the newly created view instance inside the urls.py file by adding the following code:
from .views import index

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', index, name='index')
]
```
Create a new _base.html file inside the templates/ directory:
```html
{% load compress %}
{% load static %}
<!-- templates/_base.html -->

{% load compress %}
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Django + Tailwind CSS + Flowbite</title>

    {% compress css %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'src/output.css' %}">
    {% endcompress %}

</head>

<body class="bg-green-50">
    <div class="container mx-auto mt-4">
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock content %}
    </div>
</body>

</html>
Create an index.html file that will be served as the homepage:
<!-- templates/index.html -->

{% extends "_base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1 class="text-3xl text-green-800">Django + Tailwind CSS + Flowbite</h1>
{% endblock content %}
```
Finally, create a local server instance by running the following command:
python manage.py runserver
