### Create a virtual environment ###

First, you will need to install `virtualenv` if you don't have it yet. Its convenient to use virtual environments to keep your dependencies separate and organized.

You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Then to create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
virtualenv myenv
```
Where `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Then to activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate # for Linux and macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate # for Windows
```
Where `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment. You can replace it with your preferred name.

Restart your terminal after installing `npm` to make sure it's available.
```bash
node -v

```bash
npm -v

      './templates/**/*.html'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],

### Install Flowbit ###

Flowbite is an open source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS and 
it can be installed using NPM and required as a plugin inside Tailwind CSS.

Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM:
```bash
npm install flowbite
```

Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
    ]

}
Include Flowbite inside the content value of the tailwind.config.js file:
module.exports = {
  content: [
      './templates/**/*.html',
      './node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Include Flowbiteâ€™s JavaScript file inside the _base.html file just before the end of the <body> tag using CDN or by including it directly from the node_modules/ folder:
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.3.0/flowbite.min.js"></script>
